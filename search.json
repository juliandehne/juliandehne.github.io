    "text": "After completing a BA in European Studies at the University of Passau, I sought to enhance my background with expertise in Computer Science. The dual subject teacher program in Brandenburg and Berlin uniquely offered a combination of Political Science and Computer Science, which aligned perfectly with my interests. During my stay at the University of Potsdam, I had the privilege of working under Professor Ulrike Lucke, a leading figure in e-learning research in Germany.\nFollowing my PhD, I briefly joined Humboldt University in Berlin, where I co-authored one of the first conceptual papers on fostering creativity through e-learning. Subsequently, I decided to return to my roots in the social sciences, accepting a PostDoc position at the University of Göttingen in the CSS field. Here, our team has been developing an innovative chatbot designed to facilitate deliberation on social media, which is nearing operational functionality."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Motivational Letter\nI am happy to apply for the PostDoc position in Computational Social Science due to my profound interest and the very close fit with my experience and technical skills.\nOver the last three years I worked in Göttingen on a project called Deliberation Laboratory. The goal was to develop a chatbot that could interact with social media before discussions escalated and became hateful. Here, we have established a theoretical basis, developed a research design, and carried out a human-in-the-loop experiment. The main study almost culminated, and I would be thrilled to continue the work and bring in all the insights to Zurich. We have accumulated substantial material from three years of research that is directly applicable and could be easily transferred.\nIt feels like I have just fully arrived in the CSS community. Currently, I am collaborating with three PhD students on their projects and ideas for project proposals are abundant. But my earlier career took place in the area of learning technologies. I see this as an advantage: there, I learned communicating in big interdisciplinary teams and how to build complex architectures with a social science research question in mind. Due to my two qualifications in computer science and political science I was often given the task of translator and moderator. Skills I can apply to the given position. Most of all I think that switching fields puts me in the unique position that I can fulfil a PostDoc position with enough prior experience but also with a fresh motivation and open mind for the field.\nMy fascination with computational social science began in 2008, during my parallel studies in computer science and political science. At the time, the field of computational social science did not formally exist, but my dual interests naturally converged. While word clouds were popular in political science, I was intrigued by the potential of using more complex language models for measuring political culture. Unfortunately, my early ideas were dismissed by my supervisor. Attending the EPSA conference last year gave me some satisfaction and surety of direction; natural language processing methods now dominate the field, whereas grounding my research in deliberation theory went underappreciated.\nThe proposed position demands a robust background in computational social science, natural language processing, machine learning, and databases — areas where I excel due to my formal training in computer science and my software-focussed academic career. Unlike many social scientists, my technical skills are advanced, and I can effectively communicate complex mathematical concepts, a skill I got from teaching computer science at the high school level. Additionally, my engineering experience is very relevant as research systems grow increasingly complex.\nMy main motivation is based on my strong interest to continue my career in science: collaborating, working out ideas on the whiteboard and spit-balling concepts have always been my favourite mode of work. I have always been theoretically minded and love dealing with abstract concepts. I think that I could significantly improve my academic output given the chance with your group, thus securing a permanent position in academia in the longrun.\n\nIn conclusion, my diverse interests and skills align perfectly with the interdisciplinary nature of this PostDoc position. I would be honored to further discuss my application and explore how I can contribute to your research team in Zurich.\n\nThank you for considering my application!"

    "text": "My main source of motivation is high intrinsic interest in academia and my strong affinity for teaching that lead me to train as a high-school teacher in the first place. My research interests reflect my diverse background in social sciences, education and computer science. But instead of seeing this as a disadvantage in a competitive environment where specialization matters most, I embrace it as my identity that as a scientist, naturally, I am a curious person that sees the world as interconnected and fascinating in its many interlacing fields of study.\n\n\n\nCollaborative Self-Regulated Learning: During my PhD I developed a software that supported student centered collaborative learning. However, in the absence of the leadership of a teacher, the question of how student behavior can be regulated and objectively evaluated are hard to answer. Learning analytics may help the teaching staff to find and design the right point of intervention. Creating a technological environment that includes enough manifestations of the self- or group-centered learning processes in order to form a decent picture remains one of the major challenges in the field of learning technologies.\nCreative Learning: During my time at Humboldt university I authored a paper on the operationalization of creativity for the field of learning technologies. Implementing these concepts in a learning environment would also make it more democratic in the sense that lateral thinking is given the credit it deserves alongside classical factors such as intelligence, logic and memory skills. Technology is uniquely suited to support more complex tasks that can analyze creative learning processes.\nLearning Outcomes: For the area of learning outcomes the goal was to create a general purpose generic competence-database. The basic idea was that all kinds of learning technologies share internal persistence of learning outcomes and could be integrated within paradigm of service oriented architectures.\nPeer Assessment: Also within my PhD I worked on new ways of peer assessment that included a combination of student and teacher influence. My stint at computational social sciences also gave me the idea to include rational choice experiments common in the political sciences in the area of learning technologies.\n\nA common theme is that past and planned research take place in predominantly uncharted and less known methodological spaces where it is hard to produce large quantities of papers that detail different aspects while maintaining a core methodological access point. However, while this may be a disadvantage during the focused PhD stage or even overwhelming when being the core developer in a postdoc project, I strongly believe that given the chance I could promote these issues from the fringes to a more central position within the communities of learning technologies and higher education. It is also the case that some of these issues have become more prominent lately, so that it should be easy to find suitable partners for collaboration. Here I have good starting points with the members of the projects I have worked for but also beyond.\n\n\n\nOver the past three years, I have dedicated myself to the field of computational social sciences. Although this was a detour from my primary focus on learning technologies, this experience allowed me to gain significant expertise in applied machine learning and natural language processing.\nNow, I am eager to apply these skills back to the field of learning analytics, where numerous application areas await. For instance, during my PhD, I worked on the COMPBASE project for three years which deals with creating a persistence for learning outcomes across elearning projects. This project was significantly hindered by the challenge of matching similar learning outcomes—a task that large language models can now handle with ease.\nThere are many more potential applications for these advanced tools in learning analytics, and I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to return to my original field equipped with these new competencies.\n\n\n\nI have been a researcher both in the field of educational technologies and in the field of higher education. For the stage in my career I feel well-connected to the respective communities through the GI and the DGHD. For instance, I have been part of the PC for the DELFI the last years, and I graduated from one of the most prominent learning technologies working group.\nIn terms of academic background and methodological skill I bring an especially broad set of perspectives. To paraphrase one of my mentors: yes, the academic world requires specialization and most permanent positions ask of you to be the best in the field, but it is also true that your academic identity is not the lowest common denominator but the union of the fields (education, computer science and political science) you have graduated and worked in.\n\nThank you for your consideration!"
