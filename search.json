This also allows the interpretation of a moderating post as an intervention: the result of the intervention can be computed as the sum of the effect on all conversation paths that include the moderating post.

For this, modern technologies and computer-enhanced methods are used to foster a learning environment that promotes tolerant and open speech.\nComputer technology has become an indispensable tool in educational research and practice. However, there is a gap in the case of computer-assisted political education, specifically the support of deliberation with role-plays. The aim of the proposed research group is to fill in the blanks by developing a software framework that addresses these challenges. This environment will seamlessly integrate simulations, deliberation, and learning analytics in the political education classroom.\nTechnology plays a crucial role in enhancing political science education by supporting both teachers and students in various ways. For teachers, it lowers the bar for using advanced methods by facilitating content creation, enabling the use of simulations to build intuition [@calderon_systematic_2015;@connolly_systematic_2012;@vlachopoulos_effect_2017], tracking learning outcomes [@Dehne2018_compbase_mobile;@Dehne2019_compbase_ple;@dehne2014], and overcoming barriers related to distance, language, and culture. For students, technology creates immersive learning experiences [@dishon_making_2020], offers flexible options for distance and personalized learning, and supports constructivist learning approaches [@bada2015constructivism] by providing a foundation for individual opinion formation [@chang_study_2011;@lo_adolescents_2017] and enabling self-regulated, creative learning environments [@Paa_en_2022].\nPolitical Education in Germany tries to build deliberative competencies such as taking on perspectives, discussing using arguments and moderating uncivil statements. Role-plays, a well-established method in political science education [@petrik2017handbuch;@duchatelet_unravelling_2020;@duchatelet_looking_2019], are particularly effective in fostering the ability to take on different perspectives, understand institutions and procedures. It enables the training of essential discussion, rhetoric, moderation, and academic leadership skills. Their complexity can vary: the simplest form is a discussion between two students taking pro and con sides of a current issue like reenacting an American presidential debate. But it can also be a more complex procedure like the Model United Nations [@duchatelet_explaining_2021] where students are selected in a tournament mode from all over the world to sit in the real United Nations venue and discuss world politics. Sometimes this kind of role-plays is used as incubators for actual problems [@poole_becoming_2010]. Although simulations are not the only option to support political learning with technology, it is the most obvious choice. It is one of the strengths of computer technology to create a rich but unreal environment where social processes and political acts can be studied in a safe and ethical setting.\nThe proposed research group will be situated in the computer science faculty and focus on the construction and accompanying research of the learning environment. It is thus clearly located in the engineering field and will follow the customary methodology in that area [@peffers_design_2007;@vom_brocke_introduction_2020].\n\n\nThe planned simulation environment for political learning is composed of three primary components, each interconnected to create a cohesive system. The first component, the Scenario Creation (SC), supports generating [@davis_prompt_2024] and customizing the scenarios that drive the simulations. It leverages artificial intelligence to produce realistic scenarios [@vermeiren_assessing_2022], such as a European Parliament debate on a current issue, ensuring relevance and depth. Additionally, constraint programming [@gebser2011complex] is applied to tailor these scenarios according to specified parameters, including among others time limitations, learner group size, and the intended scope of knowledge.\n\n\n\nThe second component, the Role-Playing Game Environment (PPGE), provides the structural framework for the simulation. This modularized framework guides users through the simulation process, offering three distinct settings: institutionalized environments like Model United Nations [@duchatelet_explaining_2021], deliberation-focused discussions [@gold2017visual], and rational choice-oriented decision-making scenarios [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016]. This environment interfaces seamlessly with the Scenario Creation, allowing scenarios to be easily loaded into the system. To ensure flexibility and scalability, service-oriented principles [@Benatallah2008] are employed, enabling the decoupling of various elements. The environment is also going to support a range of hardware, from mobile devices to more complex setups like AR and VR [@Zender_Buchner_Schäfer_Wiesche_Kelly_Tüshaus_2022], creating a pervasive [@Zender2013] and immersive [@Mulders2023b] learning experience.\n\n\n\nThe final component, Deliberation Analytics (DA), offers an automated framework that provides valuable insights into the discussions taking place during the simulation. This framework is designed to be transferable to other use cases, such as the National Educational Platform [@gleiss2023governance], where it can enhance or moderate online forums. Speech-to-text technology is integrated, interfacing with mobile devices to access and display real-time analytics [@gold2017visual]. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this component assesses the quality of discussions by analyzing interaction patterns [@dehne2023consistent], identifying key arguments through argument mining [@lawrence2017using], and measuring the fairness of exchanges, including time distribution and the presence of uncivil speech [@papacharissi2004democracy;@friess2021collective].\nThis design not only supports political education by making role-plays more accessible. It creates a laboratory for teaching and studying deliberation, too. This could then be used in various fields such as ethical AI, environmental studies and many other fields where a healthy discussion culture and student engagement is required. Moreover, it is situated at the intersection of the three fields of expertise of the applicant (computer science, education and political science) and thus would further qualify him for an academic career in computer-assisted (political) education and deliberation research.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical education and similar pedagogies have been supported with various levels of computer technologies. These include websites [@asal_creating_2006;@chang_study_2011], emails [@handby_2021], PowerPoint [@meibauer_teaching_2018], mobile devices [@diacopoulos_systematic_2020], virtual games [@spangenberger_embodying_2024] and second life [@jamaludin_fostering_2009]. However, a targeted and comprehensive system such as the planned one is still missing.\n\nIn the literature, there are several calls to action aimed at increasing the use of the role-play method and promoting the integration of computer-enhanced learning: [@shellman_simulations_2006] argue that role-plays are an essential part of political science pedagogies and shift the focus from “saying” to “doing” which is important in developing skills alongside political knowledge. [@kammerer_2021] title their paper “Simulations Research in Political Science Pedagogy: Where is Everyone?”. They lament the heavy emphasis on publications and tenure, which leaves little room for exploring advanced pedagogical methods in political science. While role-playing techniques are commonplace in the field of international relations, they remain underutilized and insufficiently integrated into political science education in general. [@kaiser2017einfachdigital] argue that there is an initial hurdle because the technical construction of computer-supported role-plays would be complex, but if a system were in place, it could adapt well to changing asynchronous and distance-free scenarios. In summary, these calls to action highlight the method as highly relevant but hard to implement due to workload constraints. For this reason, computational methods are seen as an important enhancement, particularly in making the method more accessible and easier to integrate.\n\nSimulations and role-plays are used in a number of application domains such as social work [@flaherty_teaching_2023], political theory [@handby_2021], climate change education [@fernandez_galeote_good_2022], business [@katzlinger_online_2008], in the medical field [@behler_eigentlich_2013] and many more. However, the method has the strongest match with the field of political education, as arguing, moderating, negotiating [@sun_assessing_2023] and taking on perspectives [@petrik2017alltagswelt] are prominent learning outcomes here.\n\nIn the field of political education the method is used mostly to teach about institutions and political systems [@cox_review_2014] that are complex and hard to connect to for the students such as the United Nations [@duchatelet_explaining_2021] or the European Union [@vermeiren_assessing_2022].\n\nAlthough the preparation of the role-cards, scenario description, etc. are a lot of work, automated approaches have not reached the field of political education yet. Educators need to balance the overhead with the expected benefits when using the method. This effect is even stronger for serious games (educational computer games) [@malo_entwicklung_2008]. To address challenges in teachers’ workload, large language models such as ChatGPT have been used as a teacher assistant for lesson planning and personalization of learning material [@KASNECI2023102274], and generating personalized learning units [@kalota_primer_2024].\n\nSerious games [@yi_designing_2011;@calderon_systematic_2015;@connolly_systematic_2012] have been a long time focus of the learning technologies community. However, there are few applications such as [@scheiner_2013] that try to integrate serious games and educational role-playing simulations. For one, the serious games movement came out of the rise of computer games, for another the role-playing is more related to a play (as in theater) than it is to gaming. However, many questions about software architectures, user experience [@moizer_approach_2019], learning analytics [@martinez_new_2022], and motivational arcs [@fernandez-sanchez_conceptual_2023] overlap between these modes. Therefore, it’s helpful to think of them as a continuum, depending on the extent to which characters are portrayed by humans or represented within a virtual environment.\n\nIn the extreme form the roles are reduced to a model of a human as a utility-maximizing rational actor [@avila-garzon_agent-based_2022;@andrade_sociological_2022]. This leads back to the political science research where rational choice experiments are used to model the effect of institutional changes or to understand the interplay of egoism and altruism in the human nature. As there already exists a software for the implementation of simulations [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016] the RPGE should integrate or extend the existing framework.\n\n\nTo evaluate the outcome of political role-playing a number of target learnings have been identified and studied. These include improved self-efficacy [@duchatelet_explaining_2021], negotiation skill [@sun_assessing_2023], structuring arguments [@sobernheim_structuring_2020] and the development of civic identities [@lo_adolescents_2017;@najjemba_engagement_2020]\n\nAll these learning outcomes combine to an improved deliberation level [@chambers_deliberative_2003]. The applicant has worked on creating software-packages i.e. [@dehne_dtrees_23;@dehne_social_media_24] to automatically analyze the quality of deliberation in discussions. He is also in the process of publishing a paper on the effect of moderation on deliberative quality using these measurements. These tools and insights can be transferred from the application field of analyzing deliberative quality in social media to the field of learning analytics. This is possible in the case of game-based learning as long as there is a live discussion as part of the game.\n\n\n\nThe research group will tackle the intersection of political education and learning technologies from the engineering perspective focussing on design principles, implementation and evaluation. To scientifically guide this process, it will try to answer the following research questions:\n\nHow can educational role-plays be designed to align with contemporary political issues?\n\nWhat are optimal parameters, prompts or other settings that produce useful scenarios?\nHow can the generation be constrained to useful input for role-plays in an educational setting?\n\nHow can computers assist in improving situatedness and immersion in political learning role-plays?\n\nWhat are the effects of game elements on the game-specific experience metrics?\nWhat are the results in terms of technology acceptance and technical performance measurements?\n\nWhat is the effect on learning outcomes given the complex interaction of method, situation, learning group and technology?\n\nHow can deliberation skills be measured?\nHow can discussion analytics be implemented as a subset of learning analytics to improve educational technologies?\n\n\nTo handle these multiple challenges, the group will consist of three PhD students in addition to the group leader who are going to focus on the three parts outlined earlier: the Scenario Creation (SC), the Role-Playing Game Environment (RPGE) and the Deliberation Analytics (DA).\nThe first task in the group will be a joint effort to write a review paper discussing the state of the art in terms of technology support for political education. This will bring all the group members up to speed and also engender team building. After that the group members will define interfaces between their projects and concentrate on working on their own component. The following describes these modules and the corresponding PhD projects in detail.\n\n\nIn recent years, large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly in their ability to generate coherent text, answer questions, and perform a wide array of language-related tasks with remarkable accuracy. These advancements stem largely from the adoption of transformer architectures [@devlin2018bert;@tay2022efficient], which have significantly enhanced the capability of models to manage long-range dependencies within a text. The transformer model, powered by the self-attention mechanism [@vaswani2017attention], excels at discerning the relevance of different text segments, regardless of their position within the input, allowing for a deeper understanding of word relationships and the generation of complex word sequences such as role-playing scenarios.\nThe SC is going to be based on the transformer architecture but will need modification to include the game aspects in the output. As a training input the German database of educational political simulations and similar resources can be used [@dechant2017planspieldatenbank; @rappenglueck2017praxis]. This part of the group will focus on finding optimal parameters, prompts or other settings that produce useful scenarios for role plays. Another challenge is going to be constraining the output to be useful and to cause little to no work for the teachers. Although this seems difficult, there are certain properties of the use case that make it likely that this can be achieved given the current state of artificial intelligence [@SALEHIN202452].\nTransformer based text generation has been reported to produce hallucinations that don’t have any grounding in facts [@hallucination_2023]. But “Simulations do not necessarily require a high degree of realism, which is why web interfaces, desktop applications, augmented environments, or fully immersive virtual realities can be chosen depending on the use case. Combinations of these scenarios can also reflect different power dynamics in asynchronous applications, such as those of a coach (bird’s-eye view through a web application) and a learner (isolated through full immersion)” [@axel_2021] (translated using AI). Less realism may well make it easier to take on the role for the students and enter the flow-experience [@zoerner_flow_2024]. It can also help to leave strong beliefs behind and be more open for the discussion. It is the teacher’s task in any case to transfer the learnings from the fictional setting to the presence.\nThe validation of the results could be in terms of usefulness, but the main evaluation will focus on algorithmic performance. For this reason, methodology from the NLP community will be prioritized. The same holds true for the constraining algorithms. For the above-shown reasons, the PhD student is going to need a strong background in computer science, particularly in the fields of NLP, Machine Learning or Logic Programming.\nTo ensure the best possible results, the PhD student benefits from strong connections at the University of Potsdam, which specializes in the research and teaching of constraint programming. Additionally, the group leader has expertise in this area, having previously taught the subject, and can contribute valuable insights and guidance.\n\n\n\nRole-plays are a standard method in education in areas where perspective-change is needed and rational judgment (ger. Urteilskraft) of social aspects is relevant. In the political education classroom it is a typical approach to let students reenact two sides of a conflict such as pro and cons of a war decision or a presidential debate. This can also be much more elaborate up to simulations that can take a week.\nOne of the challenges is to support different levels on the continuum of role-plays and simulations. [@petrik2017alltagswelt] argues that the German word “Planspiele” (translates to ‘planned games’, the author) focuses more on conflict than on recipient-orientation which means that the planned institutional games are much more abstract and professionalized than the emotionality of acting in a role-playing exercise. In this case, the main conceptual challenge is to model these kinds of role-play variants.\nThis component is going to use concepts from serious game engineering [@hou_systematic_2023;@carlier_software_2023] and existing simulation software [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016]. The resulting software framework should support the various inputs and configurations the scenario creation provides. It is also necessary to generalize the game aspects to allow for different human-computer interactions, because “the use of simulations through VR or AR technologies […] allows conflicts experienced by learners to be authentically represented. As a result, data collection can be conducted in a laboratory setting while maintaining high ecological validity” [@HUANG2021104100] (translated using AI). Instead of overloading the software with all kind of implementations, it only needs to provide an interface for different scenario adapters. In one case, this could be a simple web interface, in another, an augmented reality setting could be supported where students simulate something more interactive like a United Nations conference. This approach keeps the workload for the software implementation manageable.\nThe PhD student is going to implement only one or two game types as a proof of concept for the framework that showcases the modularity and extendability. For this, the student needs a background in computer science with a focus on software engineering. A strong interest in game development is recommended, too. In terms of input, one scenario from the role-play database should be implemented as a minimal working example of the software architecture to avoid blocking dependencies from the first component.\n\n\n\nDeliberation means a sensible, rational discussion where all the stakeholders come to a consensus that can be generally supported. It is a normative concept in political theory and can be traced back to Habermas’ discourse ethics [@habermas2009diskursethik] and Rawls’ A Theory of Justice [@rawls1975theorie]. It is a way of looking at discussions and assessing their quality [@steenbergen2003measuring] in terms of openness, tolerance and inclusiveness. The ability to participate in a productive discussion, use arguments, take on perspectives and moderate uncivil participants are important cornerstones of political education and beyond. To assess the result of role-plays, one way is to use the deliberative quality of the group discussion during the simulation as a proxy.\nThis part of the research group tackles the question of how deliberation skills are measured and how this ties into the existing research in the area of learning analytics. This is an important addition to the research group for the following reasons: a healthy discussion is not only relevant for a political education classroom. It should be desirable in all kinds of learning environments where group collaboration leads to dissemination and deliberation. Most significantly, it connects the research group to the strong trend of social media analytics in computational social science.\nOne of the technical tasks of this part of the group is to integrate the collection of speech data into the RPGE. Having access to an audio lifestream, speech-to-text technology is going to be used to have the discussion data available in the same format as discussion transcripts from social media. This is useful to reuse existing research and tooling [@dehne_dtrees_23;@duthie_classifying_2018;@gold_visual_2017]. In fact, the audio stream could also be directly piped into multimodal transformer models [@xu2023multimodallearningtransformerssurvey] if a more machine learning oriented approach yielded better results. The outcome of the analytics can be forwarded to the teacher or strategically presented within the RPGE right away.\nText data collected in the National Educational Platform [@gleiss2023governance] can be used as a provisional input to avoid a blocking dependency to an up-and-running RPGE.\nThe PhD student working on the DA part of the group needs a background in NLP, learning analytics or pedagogical psychology. A candidate from the field of computational social science might fit if the candidate can demonstrate strong computational skills.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the effect of complex pedagogical interventions is challenging. The fourth role in the group is going to focus on integrating different quality markers into one comprehensive framework. These include the technical performance markers included in the SC, the RPGE and the DA. But this also includes the effect on the teacher in terms of facilitation and the outcome for the learners in terms of personal development. [@DehneWL17] argue that the interaction of technology and education has been biased by the idea that the impact of technology always needs be evaluated in terms of learning outcomes. They argue that in some cases, the technology enhancement allows for types of learning experiences that could not be achieved otherwise. Moreover, in other cases, the main advantage of the technology is to facilitate teaching and reduce the workload in a compressed academic system.\nThe project aims at recruiting a panel of experienced teachers and students enrolled in teacher education programs. They will participate in the iterative evaluation of the technology prototype, following the principles of Design-Based Research (DBR) [@Reinmann.Januar2015]. This panel will not only assess the usability and effectiveness of the technology in each development cycle but will also serve as a benchmark to compare the difficulty of using the same methods without the aid of the technology. By establishing this gold standard, the project will provide a comprehensive basis for judging the extent to which the software facilitates the educational processes it is designed to support. Given that teachers are typically a challenging group to recruit for research studies due to workload constraints, this process will be coordinated with Lernen:Digital and the Potsdamer Zentrum für Lehrerbildung und Bildungsforschung (ZeLB).\nTo address the impact on learners, existing research on learning analytics and learning outcomes from role-plays in political education is going to be combined into an analytical framework. If possible, a double-blind study will be conducted at the end of the four-year span. In this study, the control group is going to take part in a set of classical lessons, whereas the test group executes the role-play in the constructed environment. The group lead heads the experimental setup and prepares the surveys and accompanying tests. He supervises the software development, too.\nThe overarching goal for the group lead is to develop a methodology of supporting political education with computer-technology. This encompasses …\n\n… the use of AI to generate learning content\n… the use of simulations to create an immersive and situated learning situation\n… the use of natural language processing to improve develop learning analytics for political learning\n\nThe developed prototype addresses the relevant forward-looking research areas, allowing the conceptual research to be empirically validated. This ensures that theoretical assumptions and hypotheses can be supported through practical application and empirical data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hosting chair Prof. Lucke provides a successful and fitting environment for the proposed research group as it has an impressive track record in the field of learning technologies. Further, Prof. Lucke has a lot of experience developing and hosting bigger infrastructures for learning such as the EliS project and the BIRD project. She has also published in the area of serious games and immersion. Specifically, Axel Wiebke from her group is successfully researching immersion and learning outcomes using a virtual classroom setting which fits with the RPGE engineering. Tobias Moebert, also from her group, has published in the area of mobile games and is focussing his PostDoc research on complexity and AI which fits with the SC questions.\nIn the social science faculty, the research group of Prof. Juchler works on learning places, political education and theater and situated learning. As role-plays are closely related to acting and try to simulate situated learning this could prove a valuable cooperation. Moreover, Prof. Juchler already can connect teacher candidates with the project as both participants and researchers.\nWithin the Department of Computer Science, the Chairs of Machine Learning and Logic Programming collaborate on closely related research areas. Given the applicant’s previous tutoring experience with the Logic Programming Chair, their integration into this collaborative environment is expected to be seamless.\nThe applicant brings an existing network from the University of Göttingen and the Humboldt University, as well as the GESIS, Leibniz-Institut für Sozialwissenschaften to the University of Potsdam.\nThe University of Potsdam has a reputation for leading Computer Science Research in Brandenburg and beyond. The interdisciplinary research group would form a lasting link to the political education field, showcasing the innovative potential of the region Berlin-Brandenburg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes regarding the Institution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong pre-existing focus on Data Science and Cognitive Sciences\nAn excellent infrastructure for research groups including the AI Competence Center\nAn existing network of scholars and international cooperation partners\n\n\n\n\n\nCutting-Edge AI research radiating to Social Sciences\nA big network that spans Technical and Educational Disciplines\nA prominent Lighthouse enriching the current Portfolio"

This modularized framework guides users through the simulation process, offering three distinct settings: institutionalized environments like Model United Nations [@duchatelet_explaining_2021], deliberation-focused discussions [@gold2017visual], and rational choice-oriented decision-making scenarios [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016]. This environment interfaces seamlessly with the Scenario Creation, allowing scenarios to be easily loaded into the system. To ensure flexibility and scalability, service-oriented principles [@Benatallah2008] are employed, enabling the decoupling of various elements. The environment is also going to support a range of hardware, from mobile devices to more complex setups like AR and VR [@Zender_Buchner_Schäfer_Wiesche_Kelly_Tüshaus_2022], creating a pervasive [@Zender2013] and immersive [@Mulders2023b] learning experience.\n\n\n\nThe final component, Deliberation Analytics (DA), offers an automated framework that provides valuable insights into the discussions taking place during the simulation. This framework is designed to be transferable to other use cases, such as the National Educational Platform [@gleiss2023governance], where it can enhance or moderate online forums. Speech-to-text technology is integrated, interfacing with mobile devices to access and display real-time analytics [@gold2017visual]. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this component assesses the quality of discussions by analyzing interaction patterns [@dehne2023consistent], identifying key arguments through argument mining [@lawrence2017using], and measuring the fairness of exchanges, including time distribution and the presence of uncivil speech [@papacharissi2004democracy;@friess2021collective].\nThis design not only supports political education by making role-plays more accessible. It creates a laboratory for teaching and studying deliberation, too. This could then be used in various fields such as ethical AI, environmental studies and many other fields where a healthy discussion culture and student engagement is required. Moreover, it is situated at the intersection of the three fields of expertise of the applicant (computer science, education and political science) and thus would further qualify him for an academic career in computer-assisted (political) education and deliberation research."

    "text": "Political education and similar pedagogies have been supported with various levels of computer technologies. These include websites [@asal_creating_2006;@chang_study_2011], emails [@handby_2021], PowerPoint [@meibauer_teaching_2018], mobile devices [@diacopoulos_systematic_2020], virtual games [@spangenberger_embodying_2024] and second life [@jamaludin_fostering_2009]. However, a targeted and comprehensive system such as the planned one is still missing.\n\nIn the literature, there are several calls to action aimed at increasing the use of the role-play method and promoting the integration of computer-enhanced learning: [@shellman_simulations_2006] argue that role-plays are an essential part of political science pedagogies and shift the focus from “saying” to “doing” which is important in developing skills alongside political knowledge. [@kammerer_2021] title their paper “Simulations Research in Political Science Pedagogy: Where is Everyone?”. They lament the heavy emphasis on publications and tenure, which leaves little room for exploring advanced pedagogical methods in political science. While role-playing techniques are commonplace in the field of international relations, they remain underutilized and insufficiently integrated into political science education in general. [@kaiser2017einfachdigital] argue that there is an initial hurdle because the technical construction of computer-supported role-plays would be complex, but if a system were in place, it could adapt well to changing asynchronous and distance-free scenarios. In summary, these calls to action highlight the method as highly relevant but hard to implement due to workload constraints. For this reason, computational methods are seen as an important enhancement, particularly in making the method more accessible and easier to integrate.\n\nSimulations and role-plays are used in a number of application domains such as social work [@flaherty_teaching_2023], political theory [@handby_2021], climate change education [@fernandez_galeote_good_2022], business [@katzlinger_online_2008], in the medical field [@behler_eigentlich_2013] and many more. However, the method has the strongest match with the field of political education, as arguing, moderating, negotiating [@sun_assessing_2023] and taking on perspectives [@petrik2017alltagswelt] are prominent learning outcomes here.\n\nIn the field of political education the method is used mostly to teach about institutions and political systems [@cox_review_2014] that are complex and hard to connect to for the students such as the United Nations [@duchatelet_explaining_2021] or the European Union [@vermeiren_assessing_2022].\n\nAlthough the preparation of the role-cards, scenario description, etc. are a lot of work, automated approaches have not reached the field of political education yet. Educators need to balance the overhead with the expected benefits when using the method. This effect is even stronger for serious games (educational computer games) [@malo_entwicklung_2008]. To address challenges in teachers’ workload, large language models such as ChatGPT have been used as a teacher assistant for lesson planning and personalization of learning material [@KASNECI2023102274], and generating personalized learning units [@kalota_primer_2024].\n\nSerious games [@yi_designing_2011;@calderon_systematic_2015;@connolly_systematic_2012] have been a long time focus of the learning technologies community. However, there are few applications such as [@scheiner_2013] that try to integrate serious games and educational role-playing simulations. For one, the serious games movement came out of the rise of computer games, for another the role-playing is more related to a play (as in theater) than it is to gaming. However, many questions about software architectures, user experience [@moizer_approach_2019], learning analytics [@martinez_new_2022], and motivational arcs [@fernandez-sanchez_conceptual_2023] overlap between these modes. Therefore, it’s helpful to think of them as a continuum, depending on the extent to which characters are portrayed by humans or represented within a virtual environment.\n\nIn the extreme form the roles are reduced to a model of a human as a utility-maximizing rational actor [@avila-garzon_agent-based_2022;@andrade_sociological_2022]. This leads back to the political science research where rational choice experiments are used to model the effect of institutional changes or to understand the interplay of egoism and altruism in the human nature. As there already exists a software for the implementation of simulations [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016] the RPGE should integrate or extend the existing framework.\n\n\nTo evaluate the outcome of political role-playing a number of target learnings have been identified and studied. These include improved self-efficacy [@duchatelet_explaining_2021], negotiation skill [@sun_assessing_2023], structuring arguments [@sobernheim_structuring_2020] and the development of civic identities [@lo_adolescents_2017;@najjemba_engagement_2020]\n\nAll these learning outcomes combine to an improved deliberation level [@chambers_deliberative_2003]. The applicant has worked on creating software-packages i.e. [@dehne_dtrees_23;@dehne_social_media_24] to automatically analyze the quality of deliberation in discussions. He is also in the process of publishing a paper on the effect of moderation on deliberative quality using these measurements. These tools and insights can be transferred from the application field of analyzing deliberative quality in social media to the field of learning analytics. This is possible in the case of game-based learning as long as there is a live discussion as part of the game."

    "text": "The research group will tackle the intersection of political education and learning technologies from the engineering perspective focussing on design principles, implementation and evaluation. To scientifically guide this process, it will try to answer the following research questions:\n\nHow can educational role-plays be designed to align with contemporary political issues?\n\nWhat are optimal parameters, prompts or other settings that produce useful scenarios?\nHow can the generation be constrained to useful input for role-plays in an educational setting?\n\nHow can computers assist in improving situatedness and immersion in political learning role-plays?\n\nWhat are the effects of game elements on the game-specific experience metrics?\nWhat are the results in terms of technology acceptance and technical performance measurements?\n\nWhat is the effect on learning outcomes given the complex interaction of method, situation, learning group and technology?\n\nHow can deliberation skills be measured?\nHow can discussion analytics be implemented as a subset of learning analytics to improve educational technologies?\n\n\nTo handle these multiple challenges, the group will consist of three PhD students in addition to the group leader who are going to focus on the three parts outlined earlier: the Scenario Creation (SC), the Role-Playing Game Environment (RPGE) and the Deliberation Analytics (DA).\nThe first task in the group will be a joint effort to write a review paper discussing the state of the art in terms of technology support for political education. This will bring all the group members up to speed and also engender team building. After that the group members will define interfaces between their projects and concentrate on working on their own component. The following describes these modules and the corresponding PhD projects in detail.\n\n\nIn recent years, large language models like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), particularly in their ability to generate coherent text, answer questions, and perform a wide array of language-related tasks with remarkable accuracy. These advancements stem largely from the adoption of transformer architectures [@devlin2018bert;@tay2022efficient], which have significantly enhanced the capability of models to manage long-range dependencies within a text. The transformer model, powered by the self-attention mechanism [@vaswani2017attention], excels at discerning the relevance of different text segments, regardless of their position within the input, allowing for a deeper understanding of word relationships and the generation of complex word sequences such as role-playing scenarios.\nThe SC is going to be based on the transformer architecture but will need modification to include the game aspects in the output. As a training input the German database of educational political simulations and similar resources can be used [@dechant2017planspieldatenbank; @rappenglueck2017praxis]. This part of the group will focus on finding optimal parameters, prompts or other settings that produce useful scenarios for role plays. Another challenge is going to be constraining the output to be useful and to cause little to no work for the teachers. Although this seems difficult, there are certain properties of the use case that make it likely that this can be achieved given the current state of artificial intelligence [@SALEHIN202452].\nTransformer based text generation has been reported to produce hallucinations that don’t have any grounding in facts [@hallucination_2023]. But “Simulations do not necessarily require a high degree of realism, which is why web interfaces, desktop applications, augmented environments, or fully immersive virtual realities can be chosen depending on the use case. Combinations of these scenarios can also reflect different power dynamics in asynchronous applications, such as those of a coach (bird’s-eye view through a web application) and a learner (isolated through full immersion)” [@axel_2021] (translated using AI). Less realism may well make it easier to take on the role for the students and enter the flow-experience [@zoerner_flow_2024]. It can also help to leave strong beliefs behind and be more open for the discussion. It is the teacher’s task in any case to transfer the learnings from the fictional setting to the presence.\nThe validation of the results could be in terms of usefulness, but the main evaluation will focus on algorithmic performance. For this reason, methodology from the NLP community will be prioritized. The same holds true for the constraining algorithms. For the above-shown reasons, the PhD student is going to need a strong background in computer science, particularly in the fields of NLP, Machine Learning or Logic Programming.\nTo ensure the best possible results, the PhD student benefits from strong connections at the University of Potsdam, which specializes in the research and teaching of constraint programming. Additionally, the group leader has expertise in this area, having previously taught the subject, and can contribute valuable insights and guidance.\n\n\n\nRole-plays are a standard method in education in areas where perspective-change is needed and rational judgment (ger. Urteilskraft) of social aspects is relevant. In the political education classroom it is a typical approach to let students reenact two sides of a conflict such as pro and cons of a war decision or a presidential debate. This can also be much more elaborate up to simulations that can take a week.\nOne of the challenges is to support different levels on the continuum of role-plays and simulations. [@petrik2017alltagswelt] argues that the German word “Planspiele” (translates to ‘planned games’, the author) focuses more on conflict than on recipient-orientation which means that the planned institutional games are much more abstract and professionalized than the emotionality of acting in a role-playing exercise. In this case, the main conceptual challenge is to model these kinds of role-play variants.\nThis component is going to use concepts from serious game engineering [@hou_systematic_2023;@carlier_software_2023] and existing simulation software [@chen_otreeopen-source_2016]. The resulting software framework should support the various inputs and configurations the scenario creation provides. It is also necessary to generalize the game aspects to allow for different human-computer interactions, because “the use of simulations through VR or AR technologies […] allows conflicts experienced by learners to be authentically represented. As a result, data collection can be conducted in a laboratory setting while maintaining high ecological validity” [@HUANG2021104100] (translated using AI). Instead of overloading the software with all kind of implementations, it only needs to provide an interface for different scenario adapters. In one case, this could be a simple web interface, in another, an augmented reality setting could be supported where students simulate something more interactive like a United Nations conference. This approach keeps the workload for the software implementation manageable.\nThe PhD student is going to implement only one or two game types as a proof of concept for the framework that showcases the modularity and extendability. For this, the student needs a background in computer science with a focus on software engineering. A strong interest in game development is recommended, too. In terms of input, one scenario from the role-play database should be implemented as a minimal working example of the software architecture to avoid blocking dependencies from the first component.\n\n\n\nDeliberation means a sensible, rational discussion where all the stakeholders come to a consensus that can be generally supported. It is a normative concept in political theory and can be traced back to Habermas’ discourse ethics [@habermas2009diskursethik] and Rawls’ A Theory of Justice [@rawls1975theorie]. It is a way of looking at discussions and assessing their quality [@steenbergen2003measuring] in terms of openness, tolerance and inclusiveness. The ability to participate in a productive discussion, use arguments, take on perspectives and moderate uncivil participants are important cornerstones of political education and beyond. To assess the result of role-plays, one way is to use the deliberative quality of the group discussion during the simulation as a proxy.\nThis part of the research group tackles the question of how deliberation skills are measured and how this ties into the existing research in the area of learning analytics. This is an important addition to the research group for the following reasons: a healthy discussion is not only relevant for a political education classroom. It should be desirable in all kinds of learning environments where group collaboration leads to dissemination and deliberation. Most significantly, it connects the research group to the strong trend of social media analytics in computational social science.\nOne of the technical tasks of this part of the group is to integrate the collection of speech data into the RPGE. Having access to an audio lifestream, speech-to-text technology is going to be used to have the discussion data available in the same format as discussion transcripts from social media. This is useful to reuse existing research and tooling [@dehne_dtrees_23;@duthie_classifying_2018;@gold_visual_2017]. In fact, the audio stream could also be directly piped into multimodal transformer models [@xu2023multimodallearningtransformerssurvey] if a more machine learning oriented approach yielded better results. The outcome of the analytics can be forwarded to the teacher or strategically presented within the RPGE right away.\nText data collected in the National Educational Platform [@gleiss2023governance] can be used as a provisional input to avoid a blocking dependency to an up-and-running RPGE.\nThe PhD student working on the DA part of the group needs a background in NLP, learning analytics or pedagogical psychology. A candidate from the field of computational social science might fit if the candidate can demonstrate strong computational skills.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the effect of complex pedagogical interventions is challenging. The fourth role in the group is going to focus on integrating different quality markers into one comprehensive framework. These include the technical performance markers included in the SC, the RPGE and the DA. But this also includes the effect on the teacher in terms of facilitation and the outcome for the learners in terms of personal development. [@DehneWL17] argue that the interaction of technology and education has been biased by the idea that the impact of technology always needs be evaluated in terms of learning outcomes. They argue that in some cases, the technology enhancement allows for types of learning experiences that could not be achieved otherwise. Moreover, in other cases, the main advantage of the technology is to facilitate teaching and reduce the workload in a compressed academic system.\nThe project aims at recruiting a panel of experienced teachers and students enrolled in teacher education programs. They will participate in the iterative evaluation of the technology prototype, following the principles of Design-Based Research (DBR) [@Reinmann.Januar2015]. This panel will not only assess the usability and effectiveness of the technology in each development cycle but will also serve as a benchmark to compare the difficulty of using the same methods without the aid of the technology. By establishing this gold standard, the project will provide a comprehensive basis for judging the extent to which the software facilitates the educational processes it is designed to support. Given that teachers are typically a challenging group to recruit for research studies due to workload constraints, this process will be coordinated with Lernen:Digital and the Potsdamer Zentrum für Lehrerbildung und Bildungsforschung (ZeLB).\nTo address the impact on learners, existing research on learning analytics and learning outcomes from role-plays in political education is going to be combined into an analytical framework. If possible, a double-blind study will be conducted at the end of the four-year span. In this study, the control group is going to take part in a set of classical lessons, whereas the test group executes the role-play in the constructed environment. The group lead heads the experimental setup and prepares the surveys and accompanying tests. He supervises the software development, too.\nThe overarching goal for the group lead is to develop a methodology of supporting political education with computer-technology. This encompasses …\n\n… the use of AI to generate learning content\n… the use of simulations to create an immersive and situated learning situation\n… the use of natural language processing to improve develop learning analytics for political learning\n\nThe developed prototype addresses the relevant forward-looking research areas, allowing the conceptual research to be empirically validated. This ensures that theoretical assumptions and hypotheses can be supported through practical application and empirical data."

    "text": "My main source of motivation is high intrinsic interest in academia and my strong affinity for teaching that lead me to train as a high-school teacher in the first place. My research interests reflect my diverse background in social sciences, education and computer science. But instead of seeing this as a disadvantage in a competitive environment where specialization matters most, I embrace it as my identity that as a scientist, naturally, I am a curious person that sees the world as interconnected and fascinating in its many interlacing fields of study.\n\n\n\nCollaborative Self-Regulated Learning: During my PhD I developed a software that supported student centered collaborative learning.

Creating a technological environment that includes enough manifestations of the self- or group-centered learning processes in order to form a decent picture remains one of the major challenges in the field of learning technologies.\nCreative Learning: During my time at Humboldt university I authored a paper on the operationalization of creativity for the field of learning technologies. Implementing these concepts in a learning environment would also make it more democratic in the sense that lateral thinking is given the credit it deserves alongside classical factors such as intelligence, logic and memory skills. Technology is uniquely suited to support more complex tasks that can analyze creative learning processes.\nLearning Outcomes: For the area of learning outcomes the goal was to create a general purpose generic competence-database.

    "text": "After completing a BA in European Studies at the University of Passau, I sought to enhance my background with expertise in Computer Science. The dual subject teacher program in Brandenburg and Berlin uniquely offered a combination of Political Science and Computer Science, which aligned perfectly with my interests. During my stay at the University of Potsdam, I had the privilege of working under Professor Ulrike Lucke, a leading figure in e-learning research in Germany.\nFollowing my PhD, I briefly joined Humboldt University in Berlin, where I co-authored one of the first conceptual papers on fostering creativity through e-learning. Subsequently, I decided to return to my roots in the social sciences, accepting a PostDoc position at the University of Göttingen in the CSS field. Here, our team has been developing an innovative chatbot designed to facilitate deliberation on social media, which is nearing operational functionality."

Using LLM-generated synthetic data, a BERT-model is fine-tuned successfully, so that it can distinguish calls to actions from other posts and stories on Instagram. This is contrasted with zero-shot/few-shot prompts that directly classify Instagram content.\n\n\n\nThe research fills a methodical gap to automate the analysis of social media posts by different parties in regard to CTAs. It showcases the knowledge of current technologies and also provides educational material for political scientists less experienced in the CSS field. It is well written. The language is clear and to the point. In short: it all makes sense.\n\n\n\nThe authors use current technologies that are compared with each other. Using human annotation as external validation it remains unclear why two solutions to the same problem are presented. Neither of the solutions is innovative in the sense that it would need to be compared to the mainstream approach.

It is understandable why these trending technologies are used but it appears to follow more the current hype than an internal logic of selecting the best method for the job.\n\n\n\nThe main problem lies in the sampling process.

Also, the political character of populism could be integrated. Demagogues exist outside the political arena and for a workshop specialized on political speech the non-linguistic literature of political rhetoric is missing. Since this is one of the most prominent topics in political theory since Cicero, it should be possible to leave the disciplinary bubble here. For example the rule of three is an ancient rhetorical device called tricolon.\nAlthough it is refreshing to not see AI-based methods, complexity specifically might be better glimpsed at with large language models as they might be able to capture more semantics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cover Letter\nThe Goethe-University Frankfurt was the first I studied at - for three weeks. For this reason it is usually not even mentioned on my CV. After spending a lot of my childhood in Africa, I wanted to study anthropology and ethnography. However, I quickly realized that my interest was more in the direction of political science. Having studied Latin and Ancient Greek at school, I was deeply interested in philosophy and especially political theory. For this reason I decided to study European Studies in Passau which was promised to combine cultural studies and political science. Here, I learned the meaning of critical theory and read Habermas for the first time.\nFast-forward 15 years: I have now established myself in the field of computer science. Algorithms and computer technology seem to dominate my world and I believe that if you want to critically analyse something you should understand the nuts and bolts of it. During my PostDoc years in Göttingen I was tasked to develop an algorithm that could detect moderation on social media that supports deliberation. Quickly, I understood that I had to go back to the roots. I read the Frankfurt School but was challenged from my colleagues that were American-educated and based their definitions on the Pragmatism. I spend a good part of 2022 and 2023 to reconcile what I had learned earlier about critical theory with the books of Hans Joas and other pragmatists. When I tried to bring in these thoughts, the quantitatively minded political science community rejected my papers.\nThe majority of my time in academia was spent in the field of learning technologies. However, I always felt that the field was biased towards a positive effect of technologies on the society and lacked critical thinking. I have not published a lot (in general) because my papers were usually seen as too critical towards the mainstream research. Ironically, when I followed the trend by supporting inquiry with technology during my PhD, I was awarded the best paper (GMW 2017).\nShortly after completing my PhD, I was diagnosed with heavy rheumatism. It took some time until a suitable medication was found that would not limit my concentration. By that time the chance to apply for junior professorships was over. As a consequence, I decided to switch fields to computational social science, because I had given up on an academic career and wanted to pursuit what was of interest to me.\nIn the new field, I found joy in the research but being new in the community made it hard to publish immediately. I think I have now fully arrived in the CSS community and can follow the current discussion on artificial intelligence both on the technical and on the level of its effects on learning. Still, I think that technology-enhanced learning is not viewed from a critical perspective and I would be happy to be a scholar in this particular field. I know that my publication record is far off the mark for a professorship. But my goal is an assistant professorship (Akademischer Rat) with focus on teaching as this is my profession (I am a trained high school teacher).\n\nThank you for considering my application!\nJulian Dehne"

    "text": "Introduction\nTechnology based learning plays a central part in the modern educational system. I have been asked a lot of times what my work as a researcher in online-based learning systems looks like, why it is interesting, and what the applications might be. After the COVID pandemic these questions seized. The piano teacher in the family who had almost no digital competences suddenly had to teach piano online. But shifting the teachings to the online sphere, so called digitalization, was not very successful. The same methods were applied but some practical aspects like guiding the fingers could simply not be transferred. The problem was that selectively using the advantages of technologies for learning whilst being aware of the limitations requires an extraordinary amount of training. Moreover, most technologies are not available in a simplified, tailored version that someone who has played and taught piano all her life could use. The result was the same everywhere: frustration with the new substitute methods, seemingly worse results, and no lasting changes to the educational system. During the COVID pandemic I switched my field of research to computational social sciences because I was equally frustrated: 30 years of research into computer-based learning, 10 of which I participated in were soundly ignored despite an overwhelming sudden relevance of the field. After a certain period of calming down I realized that the fault was not only with the politicians who did not differentiate between creatively using technology for the betterment of learning outcomes and the digitalization of administrative processes which they were involved in themselves. Nor did the fault lie with the teachers who were not accustomed to computers, digital whiteboards, or mobiles. The problem was that even experts in the field could not say for sure which technologies could be trusted to have a positive effect on learning outcomes. Evaluating learning outcomes is an extremely complex task. So is assessing the impact of technology, or modelling the impact technology has on humans. These questions are so difficult that there have emerged scientific fields solely dedicated to these: pedagogical psychology, human computer interaction, learning technologies and many more. The goal of this book is to develop a methodology for developing sound and standardized studies of the interplay of technology and learning, so that when the need arises, our community has more substantial lessons, and more practical tools to offer. It also allows me to delve into the philosophy of education, the sociology of technology and the fascinating interdisciplinary lines that results in different concepts of science. It is targeted at the new generation of PHD students in the field of learning technologies that are flabbergasted by the chaos as well as more experienced researchers who are interested in the philosophical reasoning for making informed practical choices."

    "text": "In einem sehr schönen Brainstorming mit Jan ist mir eine Idee gekommen, die eine Konkretisierung sein könnte: Ein Framework zum Erstellen und Evaluierung von Rollenspiele mit KI, Immersivität durch AR und mobile Learning steigern. In der (politischen) Bildung gibt es schon länger das Konzept von Rollenspielen z.B. Model United Nations, Rational Choice Spiele, oder Zukunftsszenarien (Es gibt kaum Wasser oder so). Obwohl der Lerneffekt von der Methode lange belegt wurde, ist es sehr aufwändig so etwas zu erstellen, durchzuführen und zu evaluieren. Ich habe mich in Göttingen jetzt drei Jahre mit KI und NLP, wie auch mit Diskussionsanalyse auseinandergesetzt. Mit KI könnte man die Rollenkarten und die Szenarien generieren, und das Framework würde die Durchführung des Rollenspiels orchestrieren und tracken.\nEs würde gleichermaßen meinen politikwissenschaftlichen, bildungs- und e-learning background bedienen und ich interessiere mich einfach auch sehr für Spiele. Es könnte auch das Zielfeld politische Bildung öffnen. In deinem Lehrstuhl könnte ich da mit Axel wegen AR-Ideen/Immersivität verbinden und mit Tobias wegen Komplexität (… anschaulich machen) und der alten pervasive learning Schiene. Wenn ich das richtig verstehe, würde das Anita direkt einschließen. Wegen Netzwerk hatte ich da im Studium einen guten Draht mit dem Prof. für politische Bildung. Aktuell bin ich da sehr im Hype 😊, vllt. kannst du bei dem PostDoc-Netzwerk abklären, ob das passen könnte? Ansonsten stelle ich mich auf Ernüchterung ein. Häufig gibt es doch einen Haken. Ev. wäre es zu viel neu bauen müssen?"

    "text": "All three papers illustrate my will to challenge the assumption that technology supports better learning. Riding on the digitization wave, a lot of research has tried to justify spending on technology by pushing computer-assisted learning support. However, empirical evidence to the improvement of learning outcomes is missing. I have been on both sides of this question. Most of my research has been funded by the same trend. Still, I have felt that the direction was misguided which led to me writing some critical papers on the matter.\n\n\nHere, I explore the option to use technology to enhance creative learning. This paper is important to me because it was the last I wrote in the field of learning technologies. After this, I switched fields because I could not stand the idea that we could someday teach our children by measuring their creative output. Nevertheless, I showcase my ability to link seemingly unconnected fields and think between disciplines.\n\n\n\nIn this paper I ask whether technology-based learning can be evaluated and propose some approaches. When I submitted this paper the reviewers were divided. Some wanted to give me the best paper award. Others wanted to reject it. I think with this paper I started a meaningful discussion in the community of how we evaluated the effect of technology on learning outcomes.\n\n\n\nDuring my PhD, I was tasked to model the inquiry based learning process in order to support it with learning technologies. I build a software that did not target inquiry itself but tried to improve collaborative processes by making them more efficient and by constructing a blueprint for a learning process that is peer-regulated thus following the ideal of Humboldt that students and staff should intermingle and think together."

    "text": "Motivational Letter\nI am happy to apply for the PostDoc position in Computational Social Science due to my profound interest and the very close fit with my experience and technical skills.\nOver the last three years I worked in Göttingen on a project called Deliberation Laboratory. The goal was to develop a chatbot that could interact with social media before discussions escalated and became hateful. Here, we have established a theoretical basis, developed a research design, and carried out a human-in-the-loop experiment. The main study almost culminated, and I would be thrilled to continue the work and bring in all the insights to Zurich. We have accumulated substantial material from three years of research that is directly applicable and could be easily transferred.\nIt feels like I have just fully arrived in the CSS community. Currently, I am collaborating with three PhD students on their projects and ideas for project proposals are abundant. But my earlier career took place in the area of learning technologies. I see this as an advantage: there, I learned communicating in big interdisciplinary teams and how to build complex architectures with a social science research question in mind. Due to my two qualifications in computer science and political science I was often given the task of translator and moderator. Skills I can apply to the given position. Most of all I think that switching fields puts me in the unique position that I can fulfil a PostDoc position with enough prior experience but also with a fresh motivation and open mind for the field.\nMy fascination with computational social science began in 2008, during my parallel studies in computer science and political science. At the time, the field of computational social science did not formally exist, but my dual interests naturally converged. While word clouds were popular in political science, I was intrigued by the potential of using more complex language models for measuring political culture. Unfortunately, my early ideas were dismissed by my supervisor. Attending the EPSA conference last year gave me some satisfaction and surety of direction; natural language processing methods now dominate the field, whereas grounding my research in deliberation theory went underappreciated.\nThe proposed position demands a robust background in computational social science, natural language processing, machine learning, and databases — areas where I excel due to my formal training in computer science and my software-focussed academic career. Unlike many social scientists, my technical skills are advanced, and I can effectively communicate complex mathematical concepts, a skill I got from teaching computer science at the high school level. Additionally, my engineering experience is very relevant as research systems grow increasingly complex.\nMy main motivation is based on my strong interest to continue my career in science: collaborating, working out ideas on the whiteboard and spit-balling concepts have always been my favourite mode of work. I have always been theoretically minded and love dealing with abstract concepts. I think that I could significantly improve my academic output given the chance with your group, thus securing a permanent position in academia in the longrun.\n\nIn conclusion, my diverse interests and skills align perfectly with the interdisciplinary nature of this PostDoc position. I would be honored to further discuss my application and explore how I can contribute to your research team in Zurich.\n\nThank you for considering my application!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms are increasingly at risk of losing their capacity for productive deliberation, owing to the prevalence of automated trolls, the strategic dissemination of misinformation, and the pervasive influence of marketing interests, which often overshadow empirical scientific evidence and ethically grounded values. It is therefore crucial to identify and implement proactive strategies that bolster the quality of deliberation on social media platforms.\nExtant research has explored various approaches to enhance the deliberative quality within these digital forums. These methods range from assigning responsibility to the social media platforms themselves or to the judicial legal system to approaches that penalize the users directly on the platform. Although each of these methods contributes to the enhancement of deliberative quality, it is essential to recognize that ultimately, the discourse is driven not by the platforms but by their users.\nThe dynamic of user engagement in upholding deliberative standards shows a dichotomy. On one hand, there is evidence indicating that users often assume responsibility proactively. On the other hand, the efficacy of such user-driven interventions in improving deliberative quality appears contingent on specific conditions. One key variable is the scale of user engagement. While existing literature, such as the work of [@friess2021collective], points to the positive impact of collective civic interventions — where groups of users are organized collectively — less is known about the influence of ordinary users moderating discussions on social media.\nIn this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of Twitter/X1 tweets with the question of how users react to attempts of moderation by other users and which moderation strategies work best for that purpose. First, based on previous empirical and theoretical studies, we derive a model for deliberative moderation. Then a phrase-based sampling approach is employed to identify instances of user moderation online and classify them into different strategies of deliberative moderation. Furthermore, the reaction patterns of different author compositions are analyzed as well as the impact the different strategies have in terms of their intended effect and on deliberative quality.\nThe assumption being investigated in this paper is that user moderation leads to patterns of reactions that can be categorized as deliberative (or not) depending on the type of intervention. As a consequence, the deliberative quality of the communication should increase."

    "text": "Moderation and Deliberation\nModeration constitutes a specific type of deliberative communication: building on the previous turns, it adds another layer to the discussion. Moderation shifts the focus away from the actual content to the metalevel of communication. The link to the actual content might vary widely: while some moderators refer to the content of the previous turns directly, e.g., by integrating and combining lines of argumentation, others only focus on the metalevel, for instance by asking participants to be more friendly in their communication. Researchers conclude that metacommunication (e.g., talking about the tone of the discussion) engenders more metacommunication and is usually caused by an uncivil discussion [@han2018civility, 1]. However, metacommunication does not significantly decrease incivility, but leads to more metacommunication, according to . Moderating behavior is mainly researched as part of a bundle of reactions to uncivil behavior rather than as a proactive force. It is still uncertain whether moderation shares the same preconditions and effects as metacommunication in general, or if individual characteristics can be observed.\nIn principle, as shown by @wohn2019volunteer, moderators in Twitch communities, can assume different roles. These roles include Helping hands, Justice Enforcers, Surveillance Units, and Conversationalists. @cai2019effective identify five approaches that moderators may take to dealing with problematic behaviors: Educating, Sympathizing, Shaming, Humor, and Blocking. @kraut2012building outline five key difficulties that community leaders encounter: Encouraging Contribution; Encouraging Commitment; Regulating Behavior; Dealing with Newcomers; and Starting New Communities. However, @seering2020reconsidering concludes that the effectiveness of moderation cannot be defined universally. @molina2018role hypothesize that comments condemning the incivility of other commenters would result in more civil comments and a decrease in uncivil comments. However, their findings did not yield significant results to support these hypotheses. Although they did not observe a significant impact of metacommunication on the overall civility level, which would have indicated the participants’ ability to independently change the tone of a conversation without relying on moderators, they found evidence of metacommunication being practiced. This suggests that commenters positively responded to individuals attempting to intervene and denounce incivility.\nGoing beyond the previous approaches, @friess2021collective analyze the effect of civic moderation concerning the variables rationality, constructiveness, respect, and reciprocity. Although all these are important for deliberation, they are only a subset targeting incivility, and thus missing other important process-oriented aspects like understanding, sincerity, equality, and freedom (@graham2003search), or justification (@monnoyer2012technology). It should also be noted that @friess2021collective are looking at a specialized user group selected by their organizational goal of improving social media instead of ordinary users focused on in this study. In general, @friess2021collective show that targeted counter-speech has a moderating effect on uncivil speech."

    "section": "Types of Deliberative User Moderation",
    "text": "Types of Deliberative User Moderation\nTo measure the effect of user moderation, we first need to derive a framework for deliberative moderation. So far, moderation has only been used to explain the effects on deliberative quality, but we’re not aware of any theoretical framework situating moderation within the theory of deliberative communication.\n\nTheoretical Framework\nDrawing on political philosophy and psychological research on moderation and mediation, a framework is developed that situates moderation between the deliberative function and its practice in social media. Moderation is then operationalized as a set of strategies and expressions of strategies so that it can be found and labeled in social media. Finally, a discourse-analytical framework is imported from qualitative social sciences to categorize the effect moderation has in terms of discourse component patterns. These can be interpreted as social scripts or simply as patterns of reaction to moderation. Moderation and deliberation are two concepts that can be closely linked. In the context of this study, social media is viewed from the perspective of how online communication may foster the exchange of views and arguments, and improve or worsen the social bonds that hold together democratic societies.\nModeration, as an essential component of deliberation, plays a vital role in fostering constructive and inclusive discussions. Deliberation, at its core, is the process of exchanging ideas, perspectives, and opinions to reach informed decisions. According to @stromer2007measuring, deliberation is defined [. . .] as a process whereby groups of people, often ordinary citizens, engage in reasoned opinion on a social or political issue to identify solutions to a common problem and evaluate those solutions.\nModeration is understood beyond just deletion or flagging [@friess2021collective]; it encompasses strategies used by participants to guide conversations constructively. This approach considers real-life deliberation, where speech acts cannot be erased, emphasizing comments that aim to rationalize discussions rather than censor them. In general, moderation is defined as a governance mechanism that structures community participation, fostering cooperation and preventing abuse, as per [@grimmelmann2015virtues]. @edwards2002moderator breaks down its function into three aspects: strategic, conditioning, and process. The strategic function sets the discussion’s boundaries within the community’s context, the conditioning function establishes rules and guidelines, and the process function involves managing the discussion by facilitating dialogue and mediating conflicts. @friess2021collective distinguish between different types of moderators - professional, user, and ordinary users who occasionally moderate. Ordinary users’ moderation blends with their general communication and personal agenda [@mutz2008deliberative], differing from user or professional moderators who enforce pre-set norms. Taking the above functions into consideration, five moderation functions for user moderation in social media were distilled. Figure 1 summarizes the resulting moderation strategy framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Deliberative Moderation Framework\n\n\n\nThe following gives a short intuition on why these moderation strategies in Figure 1 might be relevant to foster deliberative quality and also illuminates their basis in the literature. An in-depth discussion is outside the scope of this paper. On the one hand, “Tone Policing” and “Invoking Social Norms” are popular aspects in current research dealing with the effect on the deliberative quality of various independent variables such as incivility, rationality, affective polarization, and emotions. On the other hand, “Agenda Control”, “Engaging Participation”, and “Consensus-Seeking support” derive directly from the ideals of deliberative democracy. These will be grounded in Habermasian theory directly.\nAgenda Control focuses on organizing the spread of topics within the discussion to improve consistency and understanding [@graham2003search]. Tone Policing aims to maintain a respectful and constructive atmosphere, encouraging understanding and compromise among participants. Keeping a cool head is commonly included in the literature, with it acting both as a proxy for rationality and civility [@papacharissi2004democracy]. Although other lines of investigation exist that include anger [@kim2016beyond] or moral indignation [@hwang2018influence], the political science literature has mainly focused on rationality. With the approach of starting with the intent (or function) of the moderation, it is only logical to stick with the assumption of issue focus over emotions or relationships. Invoking Social Norms involves reminding participants of community guidelines to foster a harmonious environment [@cialdini2004social].\nEngaging Participation, and Consensus-seeking support: The strategies “Engaging Participation” and “Consensus-seeking support” were derived from the Habermasian ideal of deliberation: A conversation is a discourse if and only if a rationally motivated consensus could be achieved assuming that the arguments can be put forward as often as necessary and for as long as necessary (adapted and translated by the authors) [@habermas1981theorie, p.71]. Consensus-seeking strategies involve summarizing key points and promoting nuanced views to reach a shared understanding and a motivated consensus. In contrast to the concept of the public sphere, this communicative idea fits perfectly with the conversations held on Twitter as they do not impose any restrictions as to how often arguments are presented. Contrary to live debates they are not dependent on the physical conditions of humans becoming fatigued and can stretch time indefinitely assuming the platform stays online and the attention does not waver. The first part of the definition introduces consensus as a criterion. The following citation links the consensus building to the single participants, displaying Habermas’ efforts to integrate systems theory with symbolic interactionism and Durkheim’s theory of solidarity: a discursive consensus depends at the same time on the yes and the no of each single participants, and it depends on surpassing egocentrism. (translated by the authors) [@habermas2009diskursethik, p.19]. Engaging participation broadens the discussion by incorporating diverse perspectives, especially important in social media where attention mechanisms might limit exposure.\nIn summary, a process-oriented Habermasian concept of deliberation is used in this paper, which assumes that some sort of rational discussion is possible and that the goal of deliberative moderation is to move the discussion closer to the ideal of a calm, focused, argument-based, and consensus-oriented discussion. The framework covers low-key interventions like invoking basic norms of politeness up to higher-level functions that are more likely associated with an academic panel discussion. The advantage of this approach is that it does not require a definition of deliberative quality [@steenbergen2003measuring] which has been strongly criticized [@bachtiger2019unpacking, p.50].\n\n\nEmpirical Framework\nOur applied approach derives from a dictionary of phrases that are most likely used when moderators intervene in a conversation. For each of the five moderation strategies and based on the predefined theoretical grounds of moderation, we employ a set of terms and phrases to determine moderation. Based on this deductive approach, we have deduced around 70 moderation phrases in both English and German.\nStill, the most important challenge is contextual ambiguity: A phrase that is used to moderate can also be used in a different context – the meaning changes. As an example, let’s think about the phrase “calm down”:\n\nIf the phrase is used in a sentence like “Please calm down. No need to get nasty.”, it serves the moderation function.\nIf, however, the sentence reads “The public needs to calm down.”, the meaning of the phrase differs.\n\nThere is one obvious solution to solve contextual ambiguity: we could just derive more specific phrases, e.g. “Please calm down”. But in this case, we would miss the sentence “Calm down! No need to get nasty.” Hence, for our set of phrases, we need to balance generalizability and specificity.\nOn the one hand, the phrases should precisely define moderation – which speaks towards deriving phrases that are specific to certain tweets. On the other hand, the phrases should show general applicability. If we apply too general phrases, we would end with many false positives; in the opposite case of too specific phrases, we miss many moderation tweets (false negatives). In other words: the search query is a function of the length of the phrases.\nTo arrive at a balanced set of phrases, we labeled moderation instances based on a judgment made by three annotators. Due to vast amounts of data – we just cannot manually label thousands (or even millions) of potential moderation candidates – we chose to manually label 1,500 tweets.\n\nIn the first step, we downloaded conversations that included one of the 70 moderation phrases.\nIn the second step, the three annotators had to judge whether a given tweet entails moderation. To provide some context, the annotators were given the root tweet, the two preceding tweets, the post containing the queried phrase as well as the two following tweets.\n\nOverall, the inter-annotator agreement varies widely. While for some terms and phrases, no agreement could be made whether this tweet contains moderation, others show a high inter-annotator agreement of about 0.95 [@krippendorff2004reliability].\nWe then query those phrases at a large scale that show both a high inter-annotator agreement as well as a high precision for moderation. Using this procedure, we end up with seven phrases belonging to the strategies of tone policing, engaging participation, and agenda control.\nThe three German phrases are:\n\n“entspann dich” (calm down)\n“näher erläutern” (elaborate further)\n“bleib beim thema” (stick to topic)\n\nThe English phrases are:\n\n“back to topic”\n“back to the topic”\n“stick to topic”\n“can you elaborate”\n\nEven though we aim for an even distribution of English and German phrases for each of the three moderation strategies, not all the translated phrases show the same precision in the other language. For instance, while the phrase “calm down” marks moderation in German tweets, we could not achieve high inter-annotator agreement for English tweets."

    "text": "Research Questions and Hypotheses\nBased on the previous research and the specified theoretical grounds, we derive some specific questions that summarize our expectations. Our main research question revolves around the structure of reactions to the attempts of user moderation. RQ: Does user moderation improve deliberative quality?\nWe are mainly interested in the deliberative quality of the communication. This expectation is summarized in Hypothesis 1. \\(H_1\\): Moderation improves deliberative communication. We also derive more specific hypotheses – for each of the three moderation strategies. For instance, if the moderation strategy was focused on maintaining topic control, it becomes imperative to analyze whether the communication got back on track (reduce the variance of the topics). The same is true for the other two types of moderation: tone policing and elaboration support. Regarding \\(H_1\\), our specific expectations are\n\n\\(H_1a\\): Emotion Control improves the tone of the discussion.\n\\(H_1b\\): Elaboration Support leads to more elaboration.\n\\(H_1c\\): Agenda Control leads the communication back to the original topic.\n\nWe assume moderation to mainly be a local event. Hence, effect sizes should differ when the analysis is restricted to only a subset of the communication. When it comes to defining the size of the subset, i.e. the number of tweets to analyze, we restrict ourselves to a window of five tweets: two tweets before the intervention, the moderation, and two tweets after the intervention. Even though the first tweet might already include ample reasons to be moderated, for instance when hate speech is seen, we are mainly interested in analyzing longer discussions to allow an outcome to form. In summary, we expect moderation to affect the participation of users and the deliberative communicative quality, while taking into account different windows of communication."

    "title": "Comparing the Effectiveness of Different User Moderation Strategies for Deliberation",
    "section": "Data and Methods",
    "text": "Data and Methods\n\nData Sampling\nOur sampling strategy involves four steps. In the first step, based on the derived set of phrases, we sampled almost 140,000 tweets in English (127,782 tweets) and German (11,776 tweets) that include one of the seven phrases. The tweets were posted between February 2022 and February 2023, so we expect to see some variation over time. The distribution of phrases is skewed – both between moderation categories and between languages: with about 110,000 tweets, the vast majority of English tweets fall into the moderation category “engaging participation”. The most seen phrase in German belongs to the category “tone policing”.\nIn the second step, for a random sample of the downloaded tweets, we retrieved the full conversation. This results in a dataset of 39,371 unique conversations with a total sum of 4,298,811 tweets. But not all users directly reply to the preceding tweet. Some conversations are only referred to by using hashtags or @-mentions and contain only a low number of tweets. Please also note that in some cases, the preceding tweet(s) got deleted, starting a conversation with the second (or third) tweet. To respond to these challenges, we only keep conversations that include more than five and less than 500 tweets. The data is distilled to 25,070 unique conversations with 4,126,948 tweets.\nTo extract the response patterns, we introduce the concept of conversation paths or conversation flows. These are chains of replies that start with a root post (the first post with the opening statement of a conversation) and end with a leaf (the last contribution to a conversation). Using these structures as the unit of analysis comes close to our understanding of a discussion and also facilitates the analysis process. This approach maps the complicated network structure to quasi-linear conversations that can be interpreted analogously to a real-life discussion. To reconstruct conversational threads, we rely on the Python library [@dehne_dtrees_23].\nThis also allows the interpretation of a moderating post as an intervention: the result of the intervention can be computed as the sum of the effect on all conversation paths that include the moderating post. Similar conversation modeling describes online conversations as polyadic conversations [@magnani2012conversation], reply-graphs [@cogan2012reconstruction; @joglekar2020analysing; @nishi2016reply], or implicit thread structures [@wang2021recovering].\nAfter cleaning broken branches and filtering conversation paths, we finally arrived at a dataset of 5,017 conversation paths, 2,067 conversations, and 51,442 tweets. Overall, 9,652 different users were involved in these conversations; with an average of three users per path. On average, the longest reply-chain per conversation has a length of 123 tweets; the average length is 10.3 tweets. Since we are dealing with social media, most tweets are short: the average length of a tweet is 188 characters.\nTo summarize, the discussions we are looking at are written exchanges that can be perceived as a conversation tree with the original tweet being the root node and answers-relations represented as the edges that lead to the answers that are the nodes in the tree. The leaves of the tree are answers that have no replies (retweets/quotes).\n\n\nData Availability\nThe data used in this study is property of Twitter/X and only aggregated/processed conversation trees can be published as open data. After computing the relevant measurements only the structure is retained and could thus be published to an Open Data Repository. The analysis is reproducible and can be found on Harvard Dataverse [@DVN/HJKEBY_2024].\n\n\nDeliberative Analytics\nThe generated features are directly linked to the three moderation types: tone policing refers to the polarity of the tweets, elaboration support to the degree of justification, and agenda control to a topic analysis. All of these features are extracted using computational analytics.\n\nSentiment\nTo measure the polarity of tweets, we make use of a pre-trained multilingual sentiment model [@barbieri2022xlm]. The model is trained on about 188 million tweets in 8 languages and has been finetuned for sentiment analysis. For each tweet, the model indicates the probability of a positive sentiment, a neutral sentiment, and a negative sentiment. The sum of all three probabilities is 1. Hence, we base our analysis only on the probability of a positive sentiment and neglect the other two categories.\n\n\nJustification\nIn principle, we apply a rather similar procedure for argument analytics: Based on a finetuned model, the probability of an argument is calculated for each tweet. However, we were not aware of any reliable model to extract arguments from social media. Hence, we finetuned our own RoBERTa model. The application of the finetuned model has two advantages: first, we tune the model to respect the specific argument characteristics of social media data. Most of the available models were trained on a different type of data, e.g. oral communication. Second, we extend the base model’s capacities to a broader range of topics. With regard to the first goal, we rely on two Twitter datasets with manually annotated arguments: GerCTT [@schaefer2022gercct] and PPT4AM [@bhatti2021argument]. The latter goal – extending the range of topics – is achieved by including the XArgMining dataset [@toledo2020multilingual]. As the base model, we rely on the Twitter-XML-Roberta-model [@barbieri2022xlm]. With an F1 score of 0.805, the model works well in predicting arguments on social media. When the model is applied, for each tweet, the probability of an argument is given. The probability ranges between 0 (no justification) and 1 (justification).\n\n\nTopic Analysis\nTo extract the topics of the tweets, we apply BERTopic [@grootendorst2022bertopic]. BERTopic uses transformers and clustering algorithms to assign documents to one or more topics. Due to the bilingual nature of the conversations, we make use of the multilingual sentence transformers model as proposed by [@reimers2019sentence]. After the model has been applied, each tweet is assigned to a topic space. For instance, when 4 topics have been revealed, the probability of the tweet belonging to each of the 4 topics is given – with all probabilities summing up to 1.\n\n\n\nUnits of Analysis\nThe derived hypotheses require measuring the effect of moderation. If moderation improves deliberative communication on social media, we expect to see a difference between the tweets after the moderation and the tweets before the moderation.\nIn principle, every conversation without moderation constitutes the control group – with a number of tweets before and after every tweet in this conversation. The intervention is synthetically created, e.g. by randomly sampling one tweet within conversations without moderation. We don’t expect to see effects of moderation in the control group. However, as the discussion naturally progresses, some effects unrelated to moderation might take place. For instance, the tone of the discussion might improve anyways. Users might also feel the need to justify their claims as the discussion progresses. Or users might come back to the original topic regardless of an intervention.\nTo identify such potentially unrelated effects, we create a control group by taking a random sample of all paths without moderation. Then, in a second step, we randomly sample one tweet as a fictitious non-moderation intervention. The same rules apply to this type of non-intervention: it must take place earliest at the third tweet, and the conversation needs to last longer than one tweet after the sampled tweet. In total, we sampled 2.500 cases of non-moderated conversations.\nAs stated by the hypotheses, we need to measure the effects both globally and locally. Hence, we create two datasets: the original dataset is used as-is for analyzing the effects of moderation on the global level; no restrictions to the number of tweets apply. We take the full length of conversations. To evaluate the effects locally, we have generated a second dataset that restricts the conversations to five tweets: besides the moderation we keep two tweets before and after the intervention.\nWhen it comes to combining the first and second set of hypotheses, we need to create additional datasets. We are not only interested in comparing pre- to post-moderation tweets, but also in comparing the effects for two types of users: users that have tweeted both before and after the intervention and users that only participated before or after the intervention.\nHence, we end up with six datasets: (All) Complete conversations with all users; (All n=5) Subset of 5 tweets with all users; (Same) Complete conversations with users that tweet both before and after the intervention; (Same n=5) Subset of five tweets with users that tweet before and after the intervention; (Different) Complete conversation with users that either tweet before or after the intervention; (Different n=5) Subset of five tweets with users that either tweet before or after the intervention. All of our variables are generated for each of the 6 datasets."

    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nAs stated in our hypotheses, we focus on one distinct aspects of deliberative quality: Quantifying the effect size and strength of moderation. When it comes to the independent variables, our most important explanatory variable is the type of moderation. Additionally, to quantify the effect size, we also add moderation tweet characteristics and some control variables to the models.\n\nDependent Variables\nOur dependent variables indicate deliberative quality before and after the moderation. For tone policing to be successful, we need to see a difference in sentiment values before and after the moderation. The same is true for the degree of justification: If a user asks for elaboration, other users might be inclined to provide arguments for their claims. Regarding topics, users should get back to the original topics that were addressed before the moderation.\nWhile sentiment and justification can be compared more easily by subtracting the mean of pre-moderation values from the mean of post-moderation values – comparing topic coherence is more difficult. The main challenge is to compare a set of values over a range of topics before and after the moderation. We addressed this challenge by calculating the cosine similarity of the mean of pre- and post-moderation values. Higher values indicate similarity of topics, i.e. the tweets after the moderation address the same topics; lower values indicate that the topic distribution changes. Please note the different scale of the dependent variables: the difference in sentiment and argumentation varies between -1 and 1, the cosine similarity ranges between 0 and 1.\n\n\nIndependent Variables\nOur main independent variable is the type of intervention. In total, the dataset includes 2.610 moderation interventions. Due to missing data when generating the six different datasets, the numbers differ and are shown in Table 1. Besides no moderation (we sampled 2500 conversations), engaging participation is seen most often.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Number of Moderation Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeration Type\nAll\n\n\nn = 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepost\nSame\nDiff\nPrepost\nSame\nDiff\n\n\nno moderation\n1999\n1707\n1739\n1480\n1274\n842\n\n\nagenda control\n329\n314\n190\n273\n266\n57\n\n\nengaging participation\n1393\n1253\n1094\n1051\n972\n625\n\n\ntone policing\n221\n191\n167\n161\n140\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also include some important tweet characteristics into our models. In principle, we assume post-moderation behavior to be influenced by the type of moderation, but we also believe more friendly, more justified, and more topic-linked moderation interventions to make a difference. Hence, moderation behavior is included by sentiment prediction, argument prediction, and cosine value. The operationalization is the same as for the dependent variables.\nMoreover, some control variables are used: first, we use the number of characters of the intervention as a measure for the length of the intervention. The underlying assumption is that longer interventions have a stronger effect. The number of posted tweets quantifies the difference in participation frequency of users between pre- and post-moderation tweets. Higher values indicate different user behaviors of pre- and post-moderation, e.g. when many new users join the conversation right after the intervention. The occurrence of the moderation within the conversation is measured by the variable position. As stated in our previous sections, the lowest value is 3. We also control for the number of tweets within the complete conversation (conversation length) and the number of tweets of the conversation path (path length). The length of the path is at least two tweets longer than the position of the moderation. Finally, to control for incomplete conversations, we include variables indicating the number of deleted tweets and whether the path was fixed to the root post. The full descriptive statistics can be found in the supplemental materials."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nIn general, as seen by Table 2, throughout the models, the estimated effects of the differences are rather low. This is to be expected and confirms our expectation. This pattern also applies to the other two dependent variables – degree of argumentation and cosine similarity (see Table 3 and Table 4).\n\nSentiment\nWhen the effects of the three moderation types are compared to the reference type of unmoderated conversations, almost no significant differences can be seen. In comparison to unmoderated conversations, tone policing increases the overall tone of the conversations; but only for users who have already taken part in the discussion before the intervention. On the contrary, the overall tone decreases for different users – which is in line with our hypothesis. These contradictory results point towards the fact that users with a history in the discussion react differently towards the intervention than users who are new to the conversation. The first type of users is directly confronted by the intervention and might disagree with the intervention; the latter type of users only jumps into the discussion at a later stage. Interestingly, the effects are only significant for the complete conversations. The narrow window of five tweets does not make a difference.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Effect on Sentiment based on different Moderation Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll\n\nSame\n\nDiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\n\n\nIntercept\n-0.0304\n-0.0199\n0.0049\n-0.0347\n-0.0252\n-0.0263\n\n\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda Control\n-0.0055\n-0.0108\n0.0330*\n0.0058\n-0.0522*\n0.0149\n\n\nEngaging\n-0.0144*\n0.0115\n-0.0073\n0.0179\n-0.0343*\n0.0068\n\n\nTone Policing\n-0.0092\n0.0093\n-0.0094\n0.0053\n0.0276\n0.0262\n\n\nModeration \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment(+)\n0.1139***\n0.0447*\n0.0646**\n0.0201\n0.2073***\n0.1478***\n\n\nArgument(1)\n0.0730*\n0.0607\n0.0594\n0.0484\n-0.0141\n0.0188\n\n\nTopic\n0.0134\n-0.0049\n-0.0108\n-0.0289*\n0.0175\n-0.0083\n\n\nControls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n3703\n2826\n3244\n2524\n1565\n1302\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.017\n0.005\n0.009\n0.002\n0.054\n0.073\n\n\nAIC\n-2682.1\n-1758.2\n-1970.6\n-1021.4\n-50.0\n109.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngaging participation shows significant effects for both analytic groups, all users and different users. In both scenarios, the effect is negative, i.e. the overall tone of the conversation decreases. Again, this is in line with our hypothesis. No significant effects are seen for engaging participation. In sum, with regard to the type of intervention, there is mixed evidence. Under some circumstances, moderation makes a statistically significant difference.\nThe results in Table 2 also show significant effects for moderation behavior: being friendly while at the same time confronting other users of a conversational misconduct (of not being friendly), increases polarity. The conversations become more friendly. The same effect is seen for the level of argumentation – but only for the general pre- vs. post-moderation data. Providing justifications when users intervene increases polarity.\nWith regard to the control variables (listed in supplemental materials), a systematic effect can only be seen for different users. First, the position of the interventions makes a difference – with later interventions to increase the sentiment for new users. Second, the longer the conversation, the more unfriendly the reaction of new users.\n\n\nJustification\nThe results for justification are given in Table 3. When argumentation is taken as the dependent variable, the differences between unmoderated and moderated conversations becomes apparent: throughout the models, the intercept is negative and, in three of the six models, statistically significant. However, the effects differ per type of intervention. While tone policing decreases the degree of justification in the subsequent tweets even more, agenda control increases the amount of justification. The effect of agenda control is only significant for new users joining the discussion, for both the full conversations and the 5-tweet window of conversations. This, again, points towards the fact that the success of an intervention depends upon the type of user: users that have been participating before the intervention do not feel the need to provide arguments. On the contrary, new users show a different pattern. In sum, hypothesis 1b is only partly confirmed.\nThe models also reveal the degree of justification of the intervention to make a significant difference: justified interventions attract more justification in the subsequent tweets. This relationship is statistically significant when either the full dataset or different users are taken into account. Users who have participated before the intervention do not provide more arguments. When previous topics are addressed, less justified tweets are seen for users joining the conversation. Sentiment is only (marginally) significant for some of the user scenarios.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Effect on Justification Levels based on different Moderation Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll\n\nSame\n\nDiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\n\n\nIntercept\n-0.0390***\n-0.0367**\n-0.0192\n-0.0192\n-0.0674**\n-0.0266\n\n\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTone Policing\n-0.0153*\n-0.0249**\n-0.0180*\n-0.0312**\n-0.0033\n-0.0028\n\n\nEngaging\n-0.0002\n0.0004\n0.0033\n-0.0023\n-0.0074\n-0.0006\n\n\nAgenda Control\n0.0058\n0.0009\n-0.0001\n-0.0016\n0.0553***\n0.0334+\n\n\nModeration \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment(+)\n0.0081\n0.0183+\n0.0166+\n0.0148\n-0.0120\n0.0282\n\n\nArgument(1)\n0.0578***\n0.0503**\n0.0115\n0.0278\n0.1314***\n0.0946*\n\n\nTopic\n0.0051\n0.0048\n0.0091\n0.0071\n-0.0185*\n-0.0328**\n\n\nControls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n3585\n2784\n3148\n2487\n1467\n1237\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.007\n0.010\n0.006\n0.001\n0.017\n0.024\n\n\nAIC\n-8649.5\n-5952.5\n-6634.4\n-4576.4\n-2726.9\n-1925.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\nThe results for topic similarity in Table 4 also show a clear difference between unmoderated and moderated conversations. Unmoderated conversations are more coherent in their topics. When agenda control is applied, topics mentioned before the intervention are less likely addressed. The effect of agenda control is statistically significant when only 5 tweets are analyzed; it does not affect the full conversation. Hence, hypothesis 1c is partly confirmed.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Effect on Topic Adherence based on different Moderation Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll\n\nSame\n\nDiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\nFull\nn = 5\n\n\nIntercept\n0.5612***\n0.5298***\n0.5136***\n0.4228***\n0.3414***\n0.4266***\n\n\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTone Policing\n0.0040\n-0.0041\n-0.0099\n-0.0057\n0.0234\n0.0170\n\n\nEngaging\n0.0099\n0.0086\n0.0109\n0.0112\n0.0103\n0.0350+\n\n\nAgenda Control\n-0.0187\n-0.0635***\n-0.0136\n-0.0536**\n0.0065\n-0.2605**\n\n\nModeration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment(+)\n-0.0054\n0.0099\n0.0166\n0.0377\n-0.0306\n-0.0212\n\n\nArgument(1)\n-0.0469\n-0.0638\n-0.0809\n0.0055\n-0.0123\n\n\n\nTopic\n0.3371***\n0.3999***\n0.4146***\n0.4966***\n0.4514***\n0.4509***\n\n\nControls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n3703\n2826\n3244\n2524\n1565\n1302\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.154\n0.193\n0.204\n0.246\n0.220\n0.224\n\n\nAIC\n-895.4\n-591.5\n-252.1\n131.4\n336.0\n406.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeration behavior is only significant for cosine similarity: if users refer to previous topics when intervening, the subsequent tweets also more likely address the same topics. This effect is seen throughout the models, no matter which of the six scenarios is analyzed. The other two moderation behaviors – sentiment and justification – do not influence the post-moderation tweets.\nWhen it comes to the control variables (as seen in Table A 5), longer moderation interventions motivate subsequent users to come back to the original topics. However, the effect is rather small. Also, the position of the intervention within the conversation is significant: Later interventions decrease topic similarity for users that have been participating both before and after the intervention. Similarly, the length of the conversation correlates positively with cosine similarity. This is to be expected as longer conversations provide more possibilities to address more topics, and increase the topic space for later tweets. It becomes easier to address at least one of the various topics. The finding that, for new users, the number of deleted tweets decreases topic similarity, is also to be expected. In many instances, users refer to the later deleted tweet, which results in a low topic similarity.\n\n\nPredicted Effects\nIn Figure 3, the predicted effects are shown. In principle, the figure summarizes our previous findings: unmoderated and moderated conversations differ. However, these differences are only statistically significant for specific scenarios. In most scenarios, tone policing increases the overall tone of the conversations, decreases the degree of argumentation, and motivates users to address the original topics. Engaging participation shows a similar pattern: the sentiment value increases, justification decreases, and original topics are addressed. Agenda control is the most restricted and only proves to be successful given very specific settings. The reference group of unmoderated conversations also reveal effects unrelated to specific interventions: The sentiment value increases, the degree of justification decreases, and original topics are addressed to a large degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Predicted Effects\n\n\n\nThe most important findings in Figure 3 are revealed when the differences to the unmoderated conversations are taken into account. Tone policing amplifies the positive effect for sentiments when users take part both before and after the intervention. The same is true for the degree of argumentation: tone policing decreases the willingness to provide arguments. No clear difference for topic similarity is seen. For new users, engaging participation shows an opposite effect: the sentiment value decreases. Also, engaging participation further decreases the degree of justification. Again, no clear difference can be seen for topic similarity. Finally, the effect of agenda control is different than for unmoderated conversations: New users provide more arguments. When, however, topic similarity is analyzed, only within the window of 5 tweets, a clear difference to unmoderated conversations is seen."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nFirstly, we observed that user moderation, in contrast to more targeted, collective civic moderation, tends to produce smaller effect sizes on deliberative outcomes like the civility of the tone, the amount of justification for claims, or the coherence of the topic at hand. Our study focused on general discussions rather than specifically on hate speech, which allowed us to observe the broader implications of moderation across various conversation types. It can be argued that perfectly deliberative discussions with the highest standard of civility need moderation, too and here the rationalistic idea of moderation might apply the best. Instead of using single posts as the unit of analysis, the conversations were modeled as linear pathways in a reply tree. Most research concerned with deliberation online focuses on single posts or author groups as it is easier to sample discussions based on these criteria. Having a logical access point is important for querying the vast data available. Another explanation might be that it requires more computational methods to model and investigate the conversation trees as a graph.\nUsing this novel way of modeling conversations online, we found that longer threads of discussion are relatively rare, which can be attributed to the drop-offs in participation following moderation interventions. Our data indicates that dialogues, where two users engage directly with each other, are the most typical form of conversation. In these dialogues, the person addressed usually responds immediately, creating a dynamic interaction. This has certain implications for deliberation research online. As deliberation is thought of as a group process, dialogues need different moderation strategies. It became apparent that strategies tend to be more effective when they are appropriately tailored to the specific context of the conversation. However, it is important to note that our research did not include an in-depth qualitative exploration. Such an analysis was not the focus of this paper, as we concentrated more on quantitative assessments of moderation effects. For instance, it would be interesting to see if moderation techniques can influence the character of the response patterns which could be used as a proxy for openness. This would cater to the idea of supporting more participation to improve deliberative quality.\nFinally, we also explored windows of five consecutive posts in contrast to the complete reply paths. Our findings suggest that there are diminishing effects of the moderating intervention the longer the conversation goes on. This is in line with current research on the attention span of users and the limitations of online platforms that don’t always show the user the full picture of what happened during the previous communication. This means that the area of effect is small and repeated interventions might be an interesting object for future research."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nIn this study, we focus on the impact of moderation in online discussions, with our analysis being exclusively applied to the Twitter platform. Here, our study does not address sequential effects. This means that we did not analyze how moderation strategies might influence subsequent interactions in a conversation thread over time. Understanding these dynamics could provide deeper insights into the long-term effectiveness of moderation. Another limitation is that our analysis was confined to just seven moderation phrases. This restriction potentially overlooks a broader range of moderation tactics that could vary in effectiveness and applicability. Exploring a wider array of moderation strategies could offer a more comprehensive understanding of how different approaches influence online discussions. We also considered the variation of topics within our study. A key question that arises is whether there are specific topics that attract more moderation and subsequently exhibit better effects from these interventions. This aspect highlights the potential variability in moderation effectiveness depending on the subject matter of the discussion. It is crucial to note that this was not a user-centric study. Our approach focused more on the moderation phrases and their immediate impacts, rather than delving into the perspectives and behaviors of individual users. For this reason,\nFurthermore, we acknowledge the potential issue of endogeneity in our selection of observations. The reason why users choose to intervene in conversations (or refrain from doing so) remains unclear, which could pose a challenge in fully understanding the dynamics at play. This uncertainty is compounded by the limited validity of our control variables, which may not fully account for all relevant external factors influencing user behavior. In summary, while our study provides valuable insights into the effects of moderation on Twitter, these findings are shaped by certain limitations regarding scope, methodology, and the depth of user behavior. Future research could benefit from addressing these gaps to gain a more holistic understanding of online moderation practices."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nEven civil conversations benefit from moderation, and we evangelize changing the unit of analysis to the conversation threads instead of the posts of uncivil behavior. This way, online deliberation can be researched more analogously to offline deliberation making the results more comparable and generalizable. Although there is a small but overall significant effect of the user moderation, the intended effect of the moderation strategies is reached only in some circumstances dependent on the stability of the participant composition. In contrast, leading by example works more reliably. For instance, the findings indicate that being polite engenders politeness to some degree. Similarly, staying on topic makes it more likely that future posts will also stay on topic. This should motivate users that want to improve the public sphere online to be role models. It is harder to recommend specific strategies. These depend on the situation. In order to provide advice for platforms, civic user groups or public policy, further analysis of the long term effects of moderation is needed. But it should be a positive sign that ordinary users engage in and have positive effects with moderating metatalk without having an agenda other than their personal interests. This gives a different spin to the bleak image of the lost public deliberative online sphere."
