## KODAQs Toolbox

In my short stay with GESIS I was responsible for building a platform that aggregates open educational resources (OER) for data quality. The [kodaqs-toolbox](https://kodaqs-toolbox.gesis.org/) uses a complex pipeline of transformations to allow the OER to be developed independently on Github with different Tech-Stacks whilst maintaining the look-and-feel of a single website.

## Delab - A Chatbot Research Environment for Online Deliberation

In GÃ¶ttingen Valentin Gold and me developed a [toolchain](https://github.com/juliandehne/delab) that can download live discussions on social media to be presented for human-in-the-loop coders. This allowed us to test different moderation strategies for the chatbot to improve social media discussion.

## COMPBASE - A Generic Competency Database for Learning Organisations

While in Potsdam, I developed a pioneering concept on the persistence of learning outcomes and its applications.
However, encountering challenges in mainstreaming the [COMPBASE](https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/dehne/compbase) (not public) platform for testing, I redirected my thesis toward Inquiry-Based Learning.

## FL-TRAIL - Supporting Inquiry-Based Learning in Higher Education

During my PhD I developed the [FL-Trail](https://github.com/juliandehne/fltrail) tool that supports student-centered learning.
