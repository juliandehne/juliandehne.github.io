## Delab - A Chatbot Research Environment for Online Deliberation

In GÃ¶ttingen Valentin Gold and me developed a [toolchain](https://github.com/juliandehne/delab) that can download live discussions on social media to be presented for human-in-the-loop coders. This allowed us to test different moderation strategies for the chatbot to improve social media discussion.

## COMPBASE - A Generic Competency Database for Learning Organisations

While in Potsdam, I developed a pioneering concept on the persistence of learning outcomes and its applications.
However, encountering challenges in mainstreaming the [COMPBASE](https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/dehne/compbase) (not public) platform for testing, I redirected my thesis toward Inquiry-Based Learning.
