While in Potsdam, I developed a pioneering concept on the persistence of learning outcomes and its applications. However, encountering challenges in mainstreaming the [COMPBASE](https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/dehne/compbase) (not public) platform for testing, I redirected my thesis toward Inquiry-Based Learning, leading to the creation of the [FL-Trail](https://github.com/juliandehne/fltrail) tool that supports student-centered learning.
