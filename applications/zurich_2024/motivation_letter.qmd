I am happy to apply for the PostDoc position in Computational Social Science due to my profound interest and the very close fit with my experience and technical skills.

Over the last three years I worked in Göttingen on a project called Deliberation Laboratory. The goal was to develop a chatbot that could interact with social media before discussions escalated and became hateful. Here, we have established a theoretical basis, developed a research design, and carried out a human-in-the-loop experiment. The main study almost culminated, and I would be thrilled to continue the work and bring in all the insights to Zurich. We have accumulated substantial material from three years of research that is directly applicable and could be easily transferred.

It feels like I have just fully arrived in the CSS community. Currently, I am collaborating with three PhD students on their projects in CSS and ideas for project proposals are abundant. But my earlier career was in the field of learning technologies. I see this as an advantage: there, my work consisted of communicating in big interdisciplinary teams. Due to my two qualifications in computer science and political science I was often given the task of translator and moderator. Skills I can apply to the given position. Most of all I think that switching fields puts me in the unique position that I can fulfil a PostDoc position with enough prior experience but also with a fresh motivation and open mind for the field.

My fascination with computational social science began in 2008, during my parallel studies in computer science and political science. At the time, the field of computational social science did not formally exist, but my dual interests naturally converged. While word clouds were popular in political science, I was intrigued by the potential of using more complex language models for measuring political culture. Unfortunately, my early ideas were dismissed by my supervisor. Attending the EPSA conference last year gave me some satisfaction and surety of direction; NLP methods now dominate the field, whereas grounding my research in deliberation theory went underappreciated.

The proposed position demands a robust background in computational social science, NLP, ML, and databases — areas where I excel due to my formal training in computer science and my software-focussed academic career. Unlike many social scientists, my technical skills are advanced, and I can effectively communicate complex mathematical concepts, a skill I got from teaching computer science at the high school level. Additionally, my engineering experience is very relevant as research systems grow increasingly complex.

My main motivation is based on my strong interest to continue my career in science: collaborating, working out ideas on the whiteboard and spit-balling concepts have always been my favourite mode of work. I have always been theoretically minded and love dealing with abstract concepts. I think that I could significantly improve my academic output given the chance with your group, thus securing a permanent position in academia in the longrun.

In conclusion, my diverse interests and skills align perfectly with the interdisciplinary nature of this PostDoc position. I would be honored to further discuss my application and explore how I can contribute to your research team in Zurich. Thank you for considering my application.
