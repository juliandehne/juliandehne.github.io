# Summary


I am a Researcher and Engineer at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, with a strong background in developing open science platforms, research software, and tools to enhance reproducibility and data quality in social sciences. My current role involves leading a software project to create an Open Science platform with reusable code and tutorials, alongside conducting research on data quality standards and implementing automated tools for quality data checks.

Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Göttingen, focusing on social media deliberation, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments with platforms like Reddit and Twitter, and applying NLP techniques in Python. At Humboldt University Berlin, I researched text-based creativity detection using machine learning and analyzed large datasets from E-learning platforms.

I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Potsdam, where I developed methods for group formation, built a semantic database of learning goals, and created a framework for inquiry-based learning and evaluation methodologies for learning technologies. My expertise spans natural language processing, machine learning, data quality, and educational technologies.
